The objective is to create a class for Brownian motion.
The first use of this class is to generate sample paths of various processes related to BM, 
for example:
    - Non standard Brownian motion
    - Brownian Drift
    - Non intersecting Brownian motion
    - Geometric Brownian motion
    - Two dimensional Brownian motion
    - Local time surface
